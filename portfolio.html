    <P> 
    The picture shown above is for an App that was made in the MIT app inventor. This app is a new and improved shopping list (or to do list) 
    that can be used whenever you're heading out and you have a lot of things you need to get. Whatever items you need you just type in the text
    box and then click enter. Your items will appear on a list. As you are shopping and find things that are on the list, all you have to do is
    click on that particular item and it will delete off of your list. On this app you also have music playing if you what to put in some earbuds
    and listen to some good songs while shopping. The song can be paused or stopped at any given time, and below those buttons you will see a 
    slider for the volume. Enjoy!

       <P> 
	Above is the math problems practice game that we created in canopy (shown in the first picture), and below that is the actual game to play!
	It includes 10 math problems that range from kindergarten level to 9th grade. After you have completed those 10 questions you have the 
	option of completing 2 challenge questions at the calculus level. Have fun!

	       <h2> Distorted Imaging practice </h2>

	   <img src="Imagecanopy.png" height="400">
	<P>
	The image shown at the very top is the original copy of the beach picture that we used. The image seen underneath is the distorted image. We were
	able to duplicate the photo (which is why there are 2 distorted images on the right and not just 1). We were also able to change the image
	size and the color of the clouds and sky. The picture down below is the canopy coding of the image.

	       <h2> Data Anaylsis </h2>
	<P>
        The image shown above is a pie chart that was created in python. The question we are answering is how many people voted in the 2016 elections,
        and out of those voters how many voted for Trump versus how many voted for Clinton. We attained are data from an Official 2016 Preseidential 
	general elections results made by the elections office. We used a template from PLTW as the template for are pie chart in python.

	     <h2> NetLogo Simulation Simple Birth Rates </h2>

	<P>
	The images shown above are the original and modified Netlogo simulations. The first simulation is the original simple birth rate situation. We modified the
	other simulation by first changing the icons that were on the screen of the simulation for actual turtles (this change is shown in the code in the oval
	located down in the command center. Another change that we made was making the turtle icons bigger than the original ones. Along with making 
	the icons bigger we also made the whole screen bigger and easier to see. Another change that we made was to the population starting values and we made
	one population have a bigger starting value than another. When we adjusted the fertility of the populations we learned that if the species with a lower 
	initial population had a higher fertilty, even if it was only by 0.1, it would always survive the longest. </p>
