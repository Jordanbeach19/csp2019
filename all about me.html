	<P> 
	My name is Jordan Beach, I am a Junior at RBHS.

	<P>
	I currently run cross country and play soccer for RB, playing sports has been a great way for me to make friends
	(especially during my freshmen year when I did not know very many people). Along with playing high school sports, I also play club 
	soccer for SD Force. At school I am also involved in many clubs such as Blue Crew, Peer counseling, NHS, and CSF. These clubs and 
	sports keep me very busy at school, but schoolwork also comes first. Since it is my junior year, I am taking 4 AP classes this year
	along with taking the SAT or ACT (haven't decided which one I want to take yet though). This year is going to be very hard and fun.

<h2>My life outside of school</h2>

<P> 
Outside of school, I prefer to spend most of my time with family and friends! My favorite place to go is the beach (although 
most weekends I am too busy with soccer). Along with sports and spending time with family and friends, I am currently working
at Mathnasium in 4S. I am an instructor there and I help kids from 1st-8th grade.
